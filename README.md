For the correct view of jupyter notebook you can use <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/javosch/analizing_football_database/blob/main/analizing_football_database.ipynb#means">nbviewer</a>.

I'll be working with the european football (2008-2016) database provided from Udacity. You can find the original database <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">here</a> thanks to Kaggle user <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">Hugo Mathien</a>.<br><br>

In this analisys I'll have as objective awnser questions related to goalkeepers:<br>
    -Which is the most effective goalkeeper in the last session?<br>
    -Top 5 goalkeepers of last season.<br>
    -How does, or if, the height and weight affect performance?<br>
    -Which is the most constant goalkeeper through his active years?<br>
<br>
As this database extrac the information from the game Fifa, part of the analysis could be bias.
