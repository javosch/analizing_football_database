# Analizing Football Database

Project for the Udacity course "Fundamentals of Data Science"

All of the code was do it by me searching through StackOverflow.com, w3schools.com/python, Pandas documentation and google searchs.

Even, I don't look to the practices problems in the project section to do it all from my knowledge or investigation and learn more.
